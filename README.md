# ETF Pair Trading with Statistical and Machine Learning Methods

## Project Description
This research project explores ETF pair trading using a combination of statistical filters and machine learning clustering. The aim is to identify pairs with high mean-reversion potential using cointegration tests, z-score analysis, and unsupervised clustering (K-Means) with PCA. The final goal is to evaluate which Machine Learning methods yield the most robust and profitable trading signals.
